    <strong>How To Cook Jollof Rice</strong>
    When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don’t be in haste to dump your ingredients in the pot otherwise, you will end up with what we call ”concoction”.<br> Each step counts so try to do each of the steps in detail.
    
    <ul>
<li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
<li>The next thing is to stir in the Tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabouts.</li>
<li>Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for another two minutes.</li>
<li>Actually, by the time this ready, you will notice it in the smell.</li>
<li>If you keep it cooking any longer you might risk burning them.</li>
</ul>

    <strong>How To Make Nigerian Fried Rice</strong>
    <ul>
<li>Add the boiled rice to the stock in a medium pot and cook on medium heat until the water is dried up.</li>        
<li>Preheat the oil in a pan on medium to high heat, throw in the onions, and fry for a minute or two; add the scallions, mixed vegetables, thyme, curry powder, salt, and stock Cube.</li>        
 <li>Throw in the beef liver and rice — Stir-fry for about 3 to 5 minutes on high heat.</li>       
 <li>Take it off the heat and serve.</li>       
<li>It’s ok to add a dash of cayenne pepper if you like some heat! </li>
<li>Don’t over boil your Rice before frying it, otherwise, you will end up with soggy fried rice.</li>
<li>Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t overcook your veggies.</li>
<li>I used mixed veggies which consist of Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet Corn, and Green Beans. However, vegetables like sweet bell peppers can also be used.</li>
<li>In order to achieve that nice coveted crisp, you will need to turn up the heat to high during the frying process and stir continuously as you allow the rice to heat up.</li>
<li>I added pieces of beef liver to my fried Rice, a lot of people like this as well, but if you don’t want it you are free to leave it out, you will still enjoy the total goodness of the Fried Rice.</li>
<li>When making this Fried Rice, it is best to use Chicken stock or Turkey stock because of their mild taste.</li>
<li>The beef stock should be avoided as it can overpower the taste of the fried rice.</li>

<p id="pizza">Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, <br> cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

    <strong>How To Make Pizza</strong>
<a href="https://youtu.be/ivenBExVhsk" target="_blank">Pizza Preparation Video</a>
    <ol>
<li>Stir together the tomato paste, Italian seasoning, onion powder, minced garlic, black pepper, olive oil, water, honey (or brown sugar), and salt to taste and set aside.
</li>        
<li>Combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water in a large bowl and leave it to sit for about 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast is dissolved and foamy, then stir in the olive oil and salt.
</li>        
 <li>Add the flour and mix it until all the ingredients are well combined, then transfer it to a work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic.
</li>       
 <li>Form the dough into a ball and place it in a bowl that has been coated with olive oil. Turn it over to coat it evenly, then cover it with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let it rise for an hour or until it doubles in size.
</li>       
<li>Punch down the dough to remove the trapped air, then transfer it back to a lightly floured work surface and divide the dough into 2 equal parts.
</li>
<li>Use your hand to push the dough from the center and then maintain a circular shape. You can use a rolling pin if you find this hard to do.
</li>
<li>Dust the pizza pan with some cornmeal, place the flattened out dough on the pan, and continue to push the dough until it reaches the size of your pan, making sure you create a lip around the edge for the crust. Now leave this to rest for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings.
</li>
<li>Brush the dough with some olive oil, concentrating more on the edges. This will help to achieve the golden-brown crust.
</li>
<li>Spread the sauce on the pizza, add the cheese (I used a combination of Mozzarella and provolone cheese) and your favorite toppings, then bake in a 450 and bake for 10 to 12 minutes rotating halfway between.
</li>
</ol>
